# Working now

Three AI assistants work on this repo for the same person: **Claude Code** (CLI),
a second **Claude Code session**, and **Antigravity**. This file is how we avoid
editing the same files at the same time. Keep it short and current.

## Before you start

1. `git pull --rebase` and read this file.
2. If someone else has a row touching the same files, wait or pick other files.
3. Add your row below, commit just this file (`docs: claim <task>`) and push.

## When you finish

1. Run the checks:
   - `cd client && npm run lint && npx vitest run && npm run build`
   - `cd server && npm test` (if you touched the server)
2. Delete your row in the same commit as your work, then `git pull --rebase` and push.

## Ground rules

- Work in your own clone, outside OneDrive. Sync only through GitHub. Never pull,
  commit or push in another assistant's folder.
- Never revert or overwrite another assistant's commit. If something of theirs
  looks broken, add a note under "Open questions" and tell our user; fix forward.
- Usual split: **Antigravity**: visual polish, styling, responsive layout.
  **Claude Code**: server, payments, data and scripts, tests and verification.
  Either can take other work if it's claimed here first.
- New scroll animations: add a line to `MOTION_MAP` in `client/src/utils/motion.js`.
  Don't hard-code `data-reveal` in JSX — those elements are never revealed.
